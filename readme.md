# DIATOM ENTERPRISES CHALLENGE

The goal of this challenge will be to create a reusable Table component with some basic features and an Input component that feeds into the Table component. You have been provided a dataset and need to build the tools to ingest the information. Please review the example image and determine what features need to be built. This project should be built from scratch and using TypeScript. Please keep track of your hours so we can determine the appropriate length and reduce complexities in the future. The time you spend on this project will not determine or go against your review of the codebase.
